Assessing forest condition in the context of ongoing forest management may include: Obtaining acres of ecosystems past and present Exploring ecosystem conversion Comparing amounts of succession classes past and present 1.1 Forest Certification Forest certification, in which third-parties audit forest operations to defined standards, is used as a tool to ensure forests are well-managed and provide confidence to consumers of forest products. Many of these standards include goals and requirements to manage and restore native ecosystems. One of these systems, the Forest Stewardship Council® develops and delivers Principles, Criteria and Indicators for sustainable forest management (https://fsc.org/en/document-centre/documents/resource/392) through their national standards. Currently in the United States, FSC® Principles 6 and 9 are focused on Environmental Values and Impact and Maintenance of High Conservation Value Areas respectfully. In order for forest managers to receive FSC® certification and pass audits, many of the criteria and indicators within Principles 6 and 9 are helped by an analysis, often through a GIS assessment, of historical and current vegetation conditions, disturbance regimes, and landscape patterns.This analysis often delivers mapping and data that: Compares changes in composition and spatial patterns of historical and current ecological communities Assesses successional states of those ecosystems, past and present Documents the dominant natural disturbance regimes within ecosystems These steps, while foundational and conceptually simple, can be difficult due to the lack of data, especially when pursuing them at a landscape scale. LANDFIRE data products and ecological models offer coverage of the conterminous United States, and are appropriate for large scale assessments when information is difficult or not attainable from ground surveys. The following guide provides procedures through which forest managers may be able to conduct analyses using LANDFIRE data. These procedures in turn could aid in standard conformance and leverage high-quality, open-source data to drive restoration on suitable sites. 1.2 LANDFIRE LANDFIRE is an interagency program within the United States that “provides 20+ national geo-spatial layers (e.g. vegetation, fuel, disturbance, etc.), databases, and ecological models that are available to the public for the US and insular areas.” With this free and regularly updated data, it is possible to conduct analysis supporting environmental values and High Conservation Value Areas. In the following tutorial, we will provide guidance for: Downloading relevant LANDFIRE datasets and models Completing the GIS processing of LANDFIRE data Developing visuals (e.g., maps and charts) to help illustrate findings 1.3 GIS Tutorial Goals In general the analyses developed here will help forest managers: Assess “representation” of ecosystems within ownerships and landscapes. Map ecosystems and their conditions past and present. Understand natural disturbance regimes and compare them to current landscape disturbance patterns. Explore ecosystem conversion both to unnatural (e.g., urban) land uses and different ecosystems. Provide context for where ecological restoration or conservation of current ecosystems should be prioritized on a landscape. Assess site conditions that can be completed with existing datasets. Assess climate change and future condition considerations where possible with existing data. In the United States, including the insular areas, LANDFIRE provides the datasets and ecological model results to get at these challenges and more. Here we walk you through some of the technical steps needed to start your analysis. We will do our work in a model landscape called the Ataya Forest Tract (hereafter referred to as “Ataya”). Ataya is managed by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) under FSC® standards (FSC®C008922) and is located in the Central Appalachians (highlighted in green in map below). To help you with the concepts we have worked through pre-processed LANDFIRE data for this example landscape. To prepare the datasets for your own landscape, you may download the relevant LANDFIRE data for your own landscape and follow our steps.

After graduating from UW Madison in History and Environmental Studies, Keith worked in the private sector of ecological restoration in the greater Madison and Driftless Region of WI. Here he gained an appreciation for plant conservation, prescribed fire, invasive species management, and urban restoration projects. After working in the UW-Arboretum Longnecker Horticultural gardens, Keith received his MS in Forest Resources at Clemson University. His research focused on developing GIS land suitability models for mechanized timber harvesting and prescribed fire restoration in the Southern Blue Ridge Escarpment of SC. Keith now works in ecological restoration and wetland delineation/determination in WI and continues to research forest restoration and management with GIS applications. In his free time, Keith enjoys running, making music, writing poetry, and going for hikes in WI. Stacey Marion Stacey is an ecologist on a mission to advance conservation and land use projects using spatial analysis and visualization. She was raised in northern Connecticut where she was incredibly fortunate to grow up adjacent to a protected wetland, i.e. “the wet area”, that backed up to foothills of the Farmington Valley rift. Her early experiences bounding on tussock sedges, searching for salamanders under logs, taking spring ephemeral and rhododendron walks, and racing her sister up the ridge had a lasting imprint on her personal and professional life. Early in her career she pursued organic farming and agricultural sciences, a pursuit that brought her from upstate New York to Madison, Wisconsin. After working in agricultural sciences, she was pulled back by the allure of natural plant communities and transitioned to a career in ecological restoration. As a Restoration Ecologist, she developed and implemented science-based ecological restoration in southwest Wisconsin, where she developed an intimate relationship with the land, especially prairies, wetlands, and woodlands. She was a Board member on the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council where she helped implement prescribed fire-related policy. In advancing her GIS, programming, and design skills through an M.S. in GIS and Cartography at UW-Madison (2021), she now explores human-land use interactions from a geographer’s view. She currently works as a GIS Analyst at HDR, Inc. in Seattle, Washington. She ultimately hopes to inform conservation policy through analytics and science communication. She currently lives in North Bend, Washington where she spends her time outside of work on the trails running, skiing, or simply enjoying the awe of nature.

"],["ataya-intro.html", "2 Ataya Intro", " 2 Ataya Intro Introducing Ataya Ataya is an approximately 100,688-acre forested landscape in southeastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee. Ataya is located in Central Appalachia, and is situated in the historic territories of the S’atsoyaha (Yuchi), Shawandasse Tula (Shawnee), and the Tsalaguwetiyi (Cherokee, East) nations. You can explore these territorial claims here: (https://native-land.ca/). The largest nearby metropolitan area to Ataya is Knoxville, TN (population 186,173). Historically, the landscape encompassing Ataya was oak-dominated forests, interspersed with mesophytic forest types in low elevation ravines. In these southern Appalachian oak forests, low severity surface fires with fire intervals of 7-26 years were a dominant disturbance, as well as insect outbreaks, ice storms, windthrow, and drought. The forests in Central Appalachia experienced considerable alteration from European colonization and land use changes. Important land use and ecological changes included extensive clear-cut logging in the early 20th century, coal mining, the functional extinction of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and fire-suppression policies enacted in the early 20th century. Currently, Central Appalachia is facing population reductions in fire tolerant/shade intolerant species such as oaks (Quercus sp.) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata). Drastic population declines are also evident in eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) due to the introduction of Hemlock Wooly Adelgid. Lastly, various invasive plants (i.e. kudzu, autumn olive, Japanese stilt grass) are also significant threats to Central Appalachian forest biodiversity and resiliency. Ataya is of conservation interest due to the relatively high connectivity, large average land parcel size and projected climate change resiliency.

If using ArcGIS Pro, ensure your Spatial Analyst Extension is enabled. If you are unsure if this is enabled, you can check by going to Settings, Licensing, and ESRI Extensions. Once in the ESRI Extensions box, scroll down to Spatial Analyst. You will see if the license is active or “grayed out” (indicating you need to activate the Spatial Analyst License). Additionally, you will need Microsoft Excel (2022) and a reliable internet connection to download the LANDFIRE datasets pertinent to this analysis. Lastly, prior to beginning this analysis, we recommend that you create a new ArcGIS Pro project with a project specific geodatabase (named to your choosing!) If you are following the Ataya Study Area tutorial, please save that Study Area shapefile to your geodatabase. You’ll be able to acquire an Ataya shapefile at the end of this section. Alternatively, if you are using your own Study Area shapefile, save it to your project specific geodatabase as you follow along with this tutorial. 3.2 Methods Each subsequent chapter outlines steps to complete a different component of the GIS analysis. The general components of the analysis are: Downloading and preparing the necessary LANDFIRE datasets for a Study Area. Spatially combining these LANDFIRE datasets into one (1) new Study Area LANDFIRE dataset. Performing “Join Fields” to update the new Study Area Landfire dataset. Assessing acreage of the Study Area LANDFIRE dataset and “masking” it to the Study Area boundary. Performing data summary Excel steps to observe acreage of: historic ecosystems, current vegetation types, ecosystem conversion, and succession classes within the Study Area. 3.3 Disclaimers There are always many different ways to complete a GIS analysis and because of this, we’d like to share a few disclaimers. First, this tutorial is specific to the Ataya Study Area and outlines steps exactly performed to this Study Area. If you are using a different Study Area, you will have to locate the relevant LANDFIRE datasets and Biophysical Settings (BpS) descriptions for your Study Area through the LANDFIRE website. Second, LANDFIRE data is best represented at coarse landscape scales (i.e. landscapes in excess of 100,000 acres or more). LANDFIRE data is not as accurate for fine landscape level assessments (i.e. a forest stand of 100 acres or less). Due to the development of LANDFIRE data at large landscape scales, some LANDFIRE ecosystem data, such as Existing Vegetation Type (EVT), may not represent a 1:1 relation of the GIS data to current ground conditions. We like to think of our analysis as a guide for understanding forest conditions past and present. This guide still functions best with human input on the ground to make effective final forest management decisions. If you have smaller acreage of forest land and still wish to perform this analysis, consider using the watershed your forest is in! Third, this tutorial GIS analysis was performed using ArcGIS Pro only. Unfortunately for managers who are using older versions of ArcMap or open source GIS/data processing software (i.e. GRASS GIS, QGIS) this tutorial is not designed for these GIS platforms. These platforms can likely recreate the outcomes of this tutorial, however specific geoprocessing tools may look or act differently. If using software other than ArcGIS Pro, make sure to understand the underlying process behind each tool. If you are having trouble with this tutorial, here are some people that can assist you!

"],["input-data.html", "4 Input Data 4.1 LANDFIRE for Landscape Ecosystem Assessments 4.2 LANDFIRE Datasets Used For This Tutorial 4.3 Guidance on Obtaining LANDFIRE Products", " 4 Input Data 4.1 LANDFIRE for Landscape Ecosystem Assessments To support the assessment of a forest’s conditions, including attributes such as Environmental Impacts of management and identifying and maintaining High Conservation Value Areas, we will consider: Change between historical and current ecosystem condition. The representation of ecosystems within and outside of your landscape of interest. Change in Succession Classes (aka seral states) of communities over time. These steps, while foundational and conceptually simple, can be difficult due to a lack of data, especially when the study area of interest is large scale, occurs across multiple land ownerships, or is subject to land cover change. Using LANDFIRE spatial models overcomes this data barrier by providing a suite of terrestrial data appropriate for landscape scale analysis. 4.2 LANDFIRE Datasets Used For This Tutorial Spatial datasets, clipped to your area(s) of interest Biophysical Settings (BpS). This dataset will be used to look at “community habitat”, or where ecosystems could occur based on abiotic factors (e.g., soils, climate and natural disturbance regimes). Succession classes. This dataset characterizes structural classes on the landscape at the time the dataset represents (e.g., 2016 for LF Version 200). Existing Vegetation Type. This dataset maps NatureServe’s Ecological Systems (see descriptions here). Non-spatial products Biophysical Settings Descriptions These descriptions have information on natural disturbance regimes and succession class descriptions (also available here). Reference Condition Table supplements the BpS descriptions with the “reference” percentages for each succession class, for each Biophysical Settings. 4.3 Guidance on Obtaining LANDFIRE Products There are multiple ways to get LANDFIRE products depending on whether you are looking to obtain BpS models, their descriptions, or the spatial data: For BpS models and descriptions go to: http://landfirereview.org/search.php. Start by clicking on the “View map of LANDFIRE Map Zones”. This will help you narrow down your search. Alternatively, you can wait to download BpS descriptions until you do some GIS work and get specific names of BpSs of interest. For the spatial datasets you can explore options here which include: Downloading Full Extent Mosaics. When you do use this option you get large files that cover the entire lower 48, AK or HI (depending on your selection). We use this method when we have several landscapes and/or a large area and no computer storage issues. Using the LANDFIRE Data Distribution Site. With this method you essentially select the datasets you need then draw a rectangle (or you can select state or counties) around your area of interest to start the downloader. We recommend this if your area of interest is not too large and/or you have a low number of landscapes and/or have storage limits. Please note that LANDFIRE has gone through an update as of 2022. As a result, raster files are no longer delivered in ARCGRID formats. All LANDFIRE raster files are now delivered as TIFF with attributes.

Move the downloaded Ataya shapefile tutorial data into your project folder. Note that Pro creates a default geodatabase with the same name as your project. We recommend saving the Ataya shapefile to your geodatabase and hereafter, save intermediate layers to your geodatabase. Consider your study area: Is it appropriate to end your analysis at the shapefile boundary? If you would like information to extend beyond the study boundary, consider creating a buffer. For our tutorial, we will limit our analysis to within the provided Ataya forest tract boundary. 5.3 Download Three (3) LANDFIRE Rasters for the Study Area: BpS, EVT, and sClass There are multiple ways to get LANDFIRE products. For the spatial datasets you can explore options here, including: Use the LANDFIRE Data Distribution Site. With this method you essentially select the datasets you need then draw a rectangle (or you can select state or counties) around your area of interest to start the downloader.

Download Full Extent Mosaics to obtain large files that cover the entire lower 48, AK or HI (depending on your selection). We use this method when we have several landscapes and/or a large area and no computer storage issues. For some LANDFIRE data products, like the BpS model, the model (spatial data) and descriptions are downloaded separately: * For BpS models and descriptions go to: http://landfirereview.org/search.php. Start by clicking on the “View map of LANDFIRE Map Zones”. This will help you narrow down your search. We recommend downloading descriptions for BpS models relevant to your study area. Note that for this tutorial, we downloaded rasters by using the rectangle drawing tool and drew a rectangle that was larger than our Study Area. This ensures no raster cell data is lost in our calculations. This tutorial allows us to “cut” out that extra area in the end. If you are downloading your own data, always make sure to draw a downloading box that is larger than your Study Area to prevent GIS errors. Once downloaded, move the LANDFIRE data product downloads into your Pro project folder. You should have a BpS, EVT, and SCLASS folder. Each folder contains metadata, a corresponding database table, and a raster. 5.4 Project to the Appropriate Coordinate System The spatial reference of the Ataya tract shapefile is NAD83_StatePlane_VA_South_FIPS_4502_Feet Projected Coordinate System (Geographic Coordinate System NAD 1983). LANDFIRE data (BpS, EVT, sClass rasters) was downloaded as “Best Fit UTM (NAD83 Datum)” so the Projected Coordinate System of the LANDFIRE rasters is NAD83_UTM_Zone_17N (Geographic Coordinate System was GCS_North American_1983). Given the size and location of our study area, we’ll use the Virginia State Plane (South) as our map coordinate system. Note: unit is feet. Use the Project Raster tool to project each raster to the Virginia State Plane (South) coordinate system. Save the projected raster to the project geodatabase. Since the datum is the same for State Plane and UTM, no “Geographic Transformation” was needed. Resampling technique was “Nearest Neighbor” which is preferred for categorical/discrete data. Output cell size was in feet (98.425ft. = 30m.) Project the BpS, EVT, and sClass Rasters (sClass projection shown above). These (3) new rasters can now be used to create GIS maps for: Historical ecosystems (Bps) Existing ecosystem types and land cover (EVT) Succesion class maps (sClass) 5.5 LANDFIRE Data Stacking The three used LANDFIRE data products (BpS, EVT, sClass) provide unique aspects of land cover information. Because each raster maintains the same 30 x 30 meter cell, we can stack the LANDFIRE rasters to gain information about each arbitrary pixel within our study area. Before we combine the rasters, take a look at the attribute table for each raster. Details on attributes can be found at landfire.gov Open the Combine tool. This tool can be found by running a search in geoprocessing or you can find it in the Spatial Analyst Toolbox. Run the combine tool using the (3) project LANDFIRE rasters: us_200bps_proj, us_200evt_proj, is_200sclass_proj. Output raster was labeled combine_landfire and saved within the project geodatabase. Open the attribute table of the combine_landfire raster. You will notice that only the “Value” field was retained in the combine. Next we will perform joins to append tabular data to the combine_landfire raster. 5.6 Join BpS Tabular Data Use the Join Field tool (found with a geoprocessing search) to permanently join BpS attributes to the combine_landfire raster. Follow these parameters: Input Table = combine_landfire Input Join Field = us_200bps_proj Join Table = us_200bps_proj. Join Table Field = VALUE. Transfer Fields = BPS_CODE, BPS_MODEL, BPS_NAME, GROUPVEG. Note: selecting additional fields will prevent you from using the prepared excel pivot tables. 5.7 Join EVT Tabular Data This second join is to import EVT attributes. Open the Join Field Tool again and follow these parameters: Input Table = combine_landfire Input Join Field = us_200evt_proj Join Table = us_200evt_proj Join Table Field = VALUE Transfer Fields = EVT_NAME, EVT_PHYS. Note: selecting additional fields will prevent you from using the prepared excel pivot tables. 5.8 Join sClass tabular data The third and final join is to import the sClass attributes. Open the Join Field tool again and follow these parameters: Input Table = combine_landfire Input Join Field = us_200sclass_proj Join Table = us_200sclass_proj Join Table Field = VALUE Transfer Fields = LABEL, DESCRIPTION. Note: selecting additional fields will prevent you from using the prepared excel pivot tables. 5.9 Crop the combined raster to the study area To “cut” the combined raster to the boundary of our shapefile, use the Extract by Mask tool. Follow these parameters: Input Raster = combine_landfire Input Raster or Feature Mask Data = Ataya feature class Output raster = combine_studyArea Reminder: if you decided to create a buffer around your study area, use the buffered study area feature class as your feature mask. The resultant “combine_studyArea raster” will only contain pixels within the Ataya study region: We choose to maintain the shape of the original raster (default setting within Extract by Mask tool), and thus the resultant extracted raster has jagged edges. Note that area calculations using the raster will differ slightly from area calculated from the vector feature. 5.10 Calculate Area Field Next, we will calculate area using raster pixel size for “combine_studyArea” raster. Follow these steps: Open the combine_studyArea attribute table. Within the attribute table, create a new field called “Acres”. Select “Float” for data type to allow decimals in the calculation for acres. In the “Acres” field, right click on the top and scroll to “Calculate Field”. Select “Python 3” as the Expression Type. In “Acres =” banner, type this expression: !Count! *9687.4806249998 / 43560. Click “Apply”, then “OK”. The sum of the Acres field corresponds to the total Ataya area (~100,653 acres). Understanding the Field Calculation Expression We use raster cell size to ascertain acreage. (See: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/106883/measuring-area-of-raster-classes) . Our general calculation to determine acreage is [Pixel count of xxx unique raster value] x [Area of a pixel (feet)] x [1 acre/43,560 sqft] = xxx acres of a specific unique raster value !Count! is the number of raster pixels classified as a unique raster value. From our attribute table, we see that we have 549 unique raster values. These unique raster values hold unique combinations of our BpS x EVT x sClass data. Each original raster downloaded from LANDFIRE had a cell size of 30x30m. When we projected our rasters to Virginia State Plane South FIPS 4502 Feet, we changed the units of our rasters to feet; yielding cell size of 98.425 x 98.425 feet. The area of a single pixel is 98.425 x 98.425, equaling 9,687.4806. Therefore, we multiply !Count! by 9,687.4806. This yields the square footage associated with each unique raster value for our Study Area. To convert to acres, divide by 43,560 (1 acre = 43,560 sqft). If you are using a different unit (i.e. meters), you must adjust this calculation accordingly. 5.11 Export combine_studyArea attribute table into a .csv format Now we’ll take our GIS attribute table and make it usable in Excel. The following steps provide instructions for turning an attribute table into a .csv file. If you want to turn the attribute table into a new excel workbook, please see the appendix. Within the attribute table panel, navigate to the ‘burger’ menu on the top right, and select Export Table. Select combine_studyArea as the Input Rows. Next, select a folder location to export your table. Save the table as a logical name, such as ataya_attributes with the .csv appendage. You must manually add the .csv appendage to export as a csv. 5.12 Open the Tutorial Excel Workbook Next, open the Ataya _combineClean.xlsx in the toDownload folder containing tutorial-specific files. This template excel spreadsheet already contains the exported Ataya attribute table in the first tab. The remaining tabs contain templates for using pivot tables to summarize the Ataya attributes. If you performed the tutorial using your own study area rather than the Ataya study area, copy your csv into the Ataya_combineClean.xslx template spreadsheet in the place of the ataya_attribute tab. Name the spreadsheet to better represent your study area. Next, delete the OID, BpS code, Value, and DESCRIPTION columns to match what’s in our workbook. The following sections discuss analysis of historical conditions, current conditions, land use conversion and succession classes. "],["historical-ecosystems.html", "6 Historical Ecosystems 6.1 General Methods 6.2 Getting at amounts of historical ecosystems", " 6 Historical Ecosystems In this section we will learn which ecosystems and their extent on our landscape historically. Before we begin, let’s review our BpS GIS map and draw some quick visual conclusions: According to LANDFIRE, most of Ataya was dominated by: Southern Appalachian Oak Forest Southern and Central Appalachian Cove Forest South-Central Interior Mesophytioc Forest We can also see that most of the Southern Appalachian Oak Forest and Cove Forest is confined to the southwest portions of the Study Area. In contrast, South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forests are more prevalent in the northern portions of the Study Area. Ok- let’s move on! 6.1 General Methods In this section, and most others following, we will depend on “Pivot Tables” in Excel. These are powerful (for better or worse!) tools that allow for tasks such as: Organization and formatting of data. Calculations. Filtering data. Nesting data. With the power comes the call for caution. It is very easy to display values that look illuminating- but may be wrong. You can easily be duped into complacency, especially when working in the “value field settings.” 6.1.1 Some Potential Traps with Pivot Tables Pivot Tables allow you to calculate, summarize, format and analyze datasets. These are a few traps we run into frequently which are worth mentioning here: Your Pivot Table controls go away. This happens when you click outside of the main Pivot Table area (where your values are, usually on the left side of screen). To fix this click inside one of the Pivot Table columns. Another way to fix this is to right click inside a Pivot Table cell and select “Show field list”. Miscalculating. This typically happens when you are in the “Value Field Settings” pane and select the wrong “Show values as” option. The key here is to visually inspect the results to make sure you have made the correct selection. You want to remove totals and subtotals without having to delete them all. To fix this and many formatting issues click anywhere inside of the Pivot Table -&gt; Click “Design” from the top ribbon -&gt; click the “Subtotals” drop down -&gt; click “Do Not Show Subtotals”. Repeat for Grand Totals. While you are there, explore the Report Layout and Blank Rows drop downs. 6.2 Getting at amounts of historical ecosystems Start by opening the “Historical” tab in the Excel workbook (“combineClean”). In the Pivot Table Fields pane, select “BPS_NAME” then “ACRES”. Right click in the top cell of the “Sum of ACRES” column (not the column header) in the Pivot Table, then “Sort Largest to Smallest”. In our example we have some BpSs that have low ACRES values. We can do a little formatting/cleaning before making a chart: To remove BpSs from the table you will click the drop-down menu to the right of “BPS_NAME” in the Pivot Table Fields pane. You can uncheck BpSs as appropriate. It is also possible to filter by right clicking on the top value in the list of BpSs, then selecting Filter &gt; Top 10…. Once in that menu you can refine the filtering. To get percentages, drag “ACRES” from the top Pivot Table Field pane to the “Values” pane. This will add a second “ACRES” column to the table. Right click in the second instance of “ACRES” (reads “SUM of ACRES2” in our example) to open up a drop down menu, then navigate to Value Field Settings. In this menu select the “Show Values As” tab, click the “Show Values As” drop down then select “% of Grand Total% to get percentages of each BpS (make sure that”BPS_NAME” is selected as the “Base field”). To get a “running total” of percentages you will add a third instance of “ACRES” to the “Values” pane, then navigate to Value Field Settings. In this menu select the “Show Values As” tab, click the “Show Values As” drop down then select “% Running Total In” to get running totals of percentages of each BpS (make sure that “BPS_NAME” is selected as the “Base field”). Save! Example output Below is essentially the output from our Pivot Table work with a couple changes: Names have been shortened for ease of reading. Numbers have been rounded. We see that the top 3 BpSs comprised ~80% of our example landscape historically. We can visually confirm this and other patterns with a quick chart made in R (similar charts available in Excel by highlighting the data, clicking Insert then selecting the chart type in the “Charts” tab): "],["evt-data.html", "7 EVT Data 7.1 Existing Vegetation Types 7.2 Getting at Amounts of Current Ecosystems", " 7 EVT Data 7.1 Existing Vegetation Types While looking at the historical ecosystems gives context, we also need to get a picture of which ecosystems are on the landscape today. Like the last section, let’s first take a look at our EVT GIS Map generated using LANDFIRE’s Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) data: As we can see, there are FAR more ecosystem types present in Ataya today. In the map we see that there is far more Allegheny Dry Oak Forest/Woodland, Northern and Central Native Ruderal Forest, and recently logged cover. This map is certainty different from our Bps map! Let’s move on… 7.2 Getting at Amounts of Current Ecosystems We use the same general methods as we did on the “Historical Ecosystems” page, as we will be using another Pivot Table. Start by opening the “current” tab in the Excel workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields pane, select “EVT_NAME” then “ACRES”. Make sure that EVT_NAME is in the “Rows” pane, and that “Sum of ACRES” is in the “Values” pane. Right click in the top cell of the “Sum of ACRES” column (not the column header) in the Pivot Table, then “Sort Largest to Smallest”. In our example we have some EVTs that have low ACRES values. We can do a little formatting/cleaning before making a chart: To remove EVTs from the table you will click the drop-down menu to the right of “EVT_NAME” in the Pivot Table Fields pane. You can now uncheck EVTs as appropriate. It is also possible to filter by right clicking on the top value in the list of EVTs within the Pivot Table, then selecting Filter &gt; Top 10…. Once in that menu you can refine the filtering. * Additionally, we would like to add commas and remove decimal places. To do this right click the row that contains “Sum of ACRES” in the spreadsheet (likely row “B”), select “Format Cells” &gt; Number &gt; set Decimal places to “0” then check the “Use 1000 Separator box. To get percentages, drag “ACRES” from the top Pivot Table Field pane to the “Values” pane. This will add a second “ACRES” column to the table. Right click to open up the drop down in the second instance of “ACRES” (reads “SUM of ACRES2” in our example), then navigate to Value Field Settings. In this menu select the “Show Values As” tab, click the “Show Values As” drop down then select “% of Grand Total% to get percentages of each EVT (make sure that”EVT_NAME” is selected as the “Base field”). To get a “running total” of percentages you will add a third instance of “ACRES” to the “Values” pane, then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the “Show Values As” tab, click the “Show Values As” drop down then select “% Running Total In” to get running totals of percentages of each EVT (make sure that “EVT_NAME” is selected as the “Base field”). Save! Example output Below is essentially the output from our Pivot Table work with a couple changes: Names have been shortened for ease of reading Numbers have been rounded We have only included a selection of (5) EVTs We see that first there are many EVT’s. This is partially due to the addition of Developed and other “modern” categories such as “Recently Logged-Tree Cover”. Second we see that of the “natural” types there are some important changes from historic ecosystem conditions. In Ataya, there is currently far more acreage associated with Allegheny Dry Oak Forest/Woodland. We can visually confirm this and other patterns with a quick chart made in R (similar charts available in Excel by highlighting the data, clicking Insert then selecting the chart type in the “Charts” tab): "],["ecosystem-conversion.html", "8 Ecosystem Conversion 8.1 Exploring Conversion 8.2 The Fine Print 8.3 Pivot Table Work 8.4 Excel Steps for Preparing an Ecosystem Conversion Table 8.5 Interpreting the Ecosystem Conversion Table 8.6 Visual Exploration with a Sankey Diagram", " 8 Ecosystem Conversion 8.1 Exploring Conversion The main question we explore on this page: how much of the historic ecosystems have been converted to a different land use or ecosystem type? (e.g., agriculture, forest types). 8.2 The Fine Print While this assessment is illustrative, it is important to note that the methods used to create the BpS and EVT datasets are substantially different, and LANDFIRE datasets are not made for assessing small areas. Please review our disclaimers in section 2. In this exercise we will focus on the coarsest classifications. If you need to work at the finer classification levels proceed with caution! 8.3 Pivot Table Work Working in the “Conversion” worksheet: Check the “GROUPVEG” then the “EVT_PHYS” fields to add them to the Pivot Table. Make sure that GROUPVEG is the leftmost column. If not drag that field to the top in the Rows pane. In the cell above the “GROUPVEG” field header type “past”; in the cell above the “EVT_PHYS” type “present”. If you fancy, click the dropdown in the “GROUPVEG” header. Here you can remove different types of “GROUPVEG”. Check the “ACRES” field to add it to the Pivot Table. Explore. Of what was historically mapped as CONIFER, what’s the biggest non-CONIFER type today? Switch the order of the fields by dragging “EVT_PHYS” to the top of the Rows pane. Which GROUPVEG type was most converted to “Developed”? We can easily make excel charts and bar graphs to summarize these findings and demonstrate change from historic conditions. We can also dive a little bit deeper to generate a table that illustrates percent change from historic ecosystem conditions to current ecosystem conditions. 8.4 Excel Steps for Preparing an Ecosystem Conversion Table Here are steps to create a table summary which will allow us to view percent change of historical ecosystems (Bps) into current ecosystems (EVT): Open the “Bps2evt” worksheet In the Pivot Table, check “BPS_Name”, “EVT_Name”, and “COUNT” In the Main Ribbon of the worksheet (where File, Home, Insert, etc. are located) navigate all the way to the last Tab on the right labeled “Design”. Click on “Design”. In the “Subtotals” tab, click on the down arrow and navigate to “Do Not Show Subtotals”. Click on this option. In the “Grand Totals” tab, click on the down arrow and navigate to “Turn Off for Rows and Columns”. Click on this option. In the “Report Layout” tab, click on the down arrow and navigate to “Show In Tabular Form”. Click on this option. In the “Report Layout” tab, click on the down arrow and navigate to “Repeat All Item Labels”. Click on this option. In the top data cell for the “BPS_Name” data column, right click and navigate to “Filter”. Click on “Top 10…” In the box that opens, change “10” to 90 and “Items” to “Percent”. This will select the top 90% of BpS settings in the Ataya Study Area. To display all BpS, we would type in 100. In the top data cell for the “EVT_Name” data column, right click and navigate to “Filter”. Click on “Top 10…” In the box that opens, change “10” to 90 and “Items” to “Percent”. This will select the top 90% of EVT settings in the Ataya Study Area. To display all EVTs, we would type in 100. In the “Sum of Count” data column, right click on the top cell and navigate to “Value Field Settings”. In “Value Field Settings”, click on “Show Values As” and navigate to “% of Parent Row total” and click. Change the name of “Sum of Count” to “Percent”. Voila! We now have a table which should look similar to what’s below. For this tutorial, we have rounded our percents and are only displaying a portion of the table for better website viewing. 8.5 Interpreting the Ecosystem Conversion Table This table gives us a general idea of the percent change from historic ecosystems into current ecosystems. In our table above, we see that 57% of historic Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest/Woodland has remained as this ecosystem type within Ataya. We also see that 14% of Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest/Woodland has converted into Northern &amp; Central Ruderal Forest (a forest type marked by “weedy” generalist species). Additionally, 29% of South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest has converted into Alleghany-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest/Woodland. Here is a potential ecological interpretation for the Ecosystem Conversion Table results of our Study Area (partially based on the table and partially based on local knowledge): There is far more Allegheny Dry Oak Forest and Northern/Central Native Ruderal Forest mapped today than historically. Additionally, Southern Appalachian Cove and South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forests have greatly decreased over time. This could be due to a legacy of extensive ecosystem disturbance on the landscape. For example, we know that extensive clear-cut logging occurred all throughout the Appalachians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After these cut-over events, extensive wildfires erupted across the region due to the residual logging slash. These wildfires also spawned US Forest Service fire suppression policies in the early 20th century which altered ecosystem disturbances further. One hypothesis would be that due to homogeneous logging and wildfire disturbance across large landscape contexts, favorable conditions to shade-intolerant oak species (i.e. high light levels, open canopies, reduced duff layers) resulted in a massive increase in oak recruitment. As the forests grew back, oak became a far more common tree species and influenced the development of forest types away from maples, tulip-poplars, and other more shade-tolerant trees- typical dominants of Southern Appalachian Cover and South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forests. Additionally, as American chestnuts were lost due to chestnut blight in the early 20th century, oaks most likely took their place. We can also dive EVEN FURTHER by visualizing these ecosystem changes… 8.6 Visual Exploration with a Sankey Diagram Sometimes patterns emerge more explicitly from visuals. Below is a Sankey Diagram generated in R (which can also be created in Excel we hear. See instructions here). We used the data from our Conversion Table above to create this R figure. On the left are the historical ecosystems, on the right current ecosystems and flow bands. The width of the bands is proportional to the flow rate. Click here to the view diagram in your web browser. "],["succesion-classes.html", "9 Succesion Classes 9.1 What We Will Do 9.2 What are “Succession Classes?” 9.3 Our Sample Ecosystem 9.4 Your Tasks", " 9 Succesion Classes 9.1 What We Will Do While looking at the conversion of historical ecosystems is valuable, we can perform more analyses by comparing amounts historical succession classes to current. This gives us a broad measure of the changes in vegetation structure for ecosystems. 9.2 What are “Succession Classes?” In general LANDFIRE succession classes are stages of development defined in the descriptions of each Biophysical Setting. They are characterized by vegetation height, canopy cover and to some degree species composition. Key takeaways: To learn what the succession classes are for each Biophysical Setting, look to the corresponding description on http://landfirereview.org/test/search.php LANDFIRE used state and transition models to estimate the amount of each succession class that would occur with natural (pre-European colonization) disturbance regimes. Historical succession classes were not mapped as they were assumed to move around over time. The Succession Class dataset maps the current location of succession classes, agricultural/developed land-use classes, and uncharacteristic vegetation. Uncharacteristic typically represents exotic vegetation, or vegetation structure that would not have occurred historically. By comparing the amounts of historical and current succession classes you can get a sense of which classes are over/under represented. This assumes that the landscape you are assessing is large enough to potentially include the full compliment of succession classes. 9.3 Our Sample Ecosystem First, let’s take another look at our sClass GIS map for some visual context: We see that most of the succession classes in Ataya are in Succession Class B, D, and E. There is also a large amount of area devoted to UE: Uncharacteristic Exotic Vegetation (i.e. invasive species). We see that less area is devoted to UN: Uncharacteristic Native Vegetation (i.e. canopy cover not found historically or plantain forests). To illustrate the concept of comparing reference to current succession classes, we will focus on the South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest Biophysical Setting. It is a dominant ecosystem in the Ataya, has been heavily managed (including extensive clear cut logging), and faces many threats such as deer browsing and in isolated pockets hemlock woody adelgid damage. 9.4 Your Tasks We will start with our friend the Pivot Table to get current percentages of the relevant succession classes, then we will look to the Biophysical Settings descriptions to get historical percentages. 9.4.1 Current Succession Classes Open the “successionClasses” worksheet in our “Ataya_combineClean.xlsx” workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields box highlight “BPS_MODEL” -&gt; click the down arrow -&gt; select only “South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest”. Check the box next to “BPS_NAME”. In the Pivot Table Fields check the box next to “LABEL” to get a list of current succession classes. In the Pivot Table Fields check the box next to “ACRES”. In the Values pane click the down arrow -&gt; select Value Field Settings. Once the Value field settings are open click Show Values As -&gt; select “% of Grand Total” from the dropdown list. Copy the resultant table -&gt; paste next to the Pivot Table in the same worksheet -&gt; add column names “Succession class” and “Current”. 9.4.2 Historical Succession Classes Open the “SouthMesophytic.docx” document that is in the “toDownload” zipped folder. This document is our BpS Model Descriptions for the South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest Ecosystem. Skim through the document to get a sense of the forest ecosystem, paying particular attention to the “Succession Classes” section. Within the South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest Ecosystem, there are 5 succession classes, A, B, C, D and E with corresponding estimated reference amounts of percent area. Note that as disturbances moved around historically, a precise acreage amount is not defined in the description. This percent area number may be found just to the right of the class description. For example, Succession Class A was modeled to be rare in this ecosystem as fire was infrequent with the average fire return interval for the ecosystem being 50-200 years. LANDFIRE estimated that only 2% of this ecosystem area (note the “2” next to “Class A”) would have been in Succession Class A historically. We can also see within the document descriptions of the vegetative structure associated with each succession class in this forest type. For example, Succession Class B in this forest type is described as being “Mid-seral closed overstory; stem exclusion phase” among other descriptions. This description indicates younger trees are rapidly growing and crowding one another, and resource competition has drastically increased as a result. Back in the pivot table, you will create a new column named “Historical”, then type the succession class percentages from the document into the corresponding row. With the newly created column, we can start to see some patterns emerge. What do you see? Can you draw any conclusions for forest management within the Ataya for this forest ecosystem? 9.4.3 Example Interpretation for South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forests Based on the BpS Model descriptions for this forest ecosystem, we see historically that Succession Class D occupied the greatest land area in the ecosystem at 55%. This Succession Class is marked by late-succession trees, multiple canopy strata, various regeneration of different age and size classes, and infrequent surface fires. The next dominant succession class was Class C at 32% which is described as a closed canopy mixed-mesic forest. Now let’s take a look at our current succession classes within South-Central Interior Mesophytic forests. We see that currently approximately 0.11% of the South-Central Interior Mesophytic forest is in Succession Class D. Class C represents 10% of the land area, and it now appears that Class B dominates this forest ecosystem at approximately 74% of the land area. Recall that Class B is a mid-seral closed canopy forest that is younger in its age class. The forest structure is marked by many crowded young trees all competing for resources. In our modeling descriptions, this Succession Class is stated to “remain in this self-thinning, closed canopy condition for decades”. Given the history of extensive logging within the region, this forest ecosystem could still be recovering from these massive landscape-scale disturbances. In the context of this forest ecosystem’s management, perhaps we want to conserve the self-thinning process of the forest. Perhaps if logging is to be employed in this forest ecosystem, only selective thinning treatments should be utilized to facilitate self-thinning. In essence, perhaps this forest ecosystem needs to keep growing and aging rather than experiencing major canopy gap disturbances. "],["conclusions.html", "10 Conclusions 10.1 Bringing it All Together 10.2 Recap for certified forest management", " 10 Conclusions 10.1 Bringing it All Together We’ve got a lot of useful deliverables from our analysis (GIS maps, tables, charts, interpretations) but let’s spend some time bringing all our analyses together. For Ataya, we see that historically our forest was dominated mostly by Southern Appalachian Oak Forest, Southern and Central Appalachian Cove Forest, and South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forests. We also know the current forests have shifted most to Allegeheny Dry Oak Forest/Woodland. Southern and Central Appalachian Cove Forests have experienced a particularly high degree of ecosystem conversion. Additionally, Ataya has large areas of uncharacteristic exotic vegetation and native ruderal forest. Let’s draw some potential forest management implications. This is not an exhaustive list by any means- just some ideas to get the creative juices flowing. Feel free to revisit our previous sections to view GIS maps and charts! We see a very high departure from historic conditions for Ataya. Our restoration efforts shouldn’t be focused on re-converting everything back to our BpS map as this is not feasible. This is not to say we should avoid preserving and locating unchanged forest. We can use our BpS and EVT maps to potentially find areas where the forests have remained stable for longer periods of time, and use these areas as representatives of historic conditions for teaching purposes, genotype conservation, and seed collection/preservation among other things. Perhaps we need to spend some extra time mapping Cove Forest communities in the field. If this forest type is experiencing particular heavy ecosystem conversion, it may be important we assess, preserve, and more intimately manage the best representations of that forest community type. We have a better idea of where we may need to concentrate efforts on invasive plant management. This includes areas in the southern portions of Ataya where concentrated pockets of uncharacteristic exotic vegetation can be observed. A field assessment could confirm these suspicions and influence an Integrated Pest Management plan. We know that oaks require specific shade-reduced conditions to regenerate and recruit into the forest canopy. Based on the level of oak community types present on the landscape now, prescribed fire and timber harvesting to facilitate oak regeneration (i.e. thinning, shelterwood cuts) will be incredibly important for a forest management plan/strategy. Since most of the oak dominated forests in the south of Ataya are in Succession Class D and E (i.e. more closed canopy conditions), prescribed fire and harvesting activities to facilitate tree canopy gaps and oak recruitment may be very important in this section of the forest. 10.2 Recap for certified forest management After our analysis is complete, we can see that we have provided the following for demonstrating conformance to certified sustainable forest management standards: Maps and acreage for historic ecosystems Maps and acreage for current ecosystems/land cover Mapss of current Forest Succession Classes Tables to assess ecosystem conversion Tables to assess acreage for historic and present conditions Some strategies for developing management implications with LANDFIRE We hope you have enjoyed our tutorial.
